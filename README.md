My turtle was drawing only one line even though I wanted it to be a square
I remembered how angles worked
I made it turn 90 degrees instead of 180


It wasn't compiling in the 3rd task because I put i for both of the for loops
I had to look at other codes for reference in order to figure it out
I replaced one of the "i"s with an x
